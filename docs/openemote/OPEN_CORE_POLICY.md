# OpenEmote Open Core Policy

This fork follows an open-core, user-first policy.

## Non-negotiable rules

1. Core chat and emote functionality stays open source.
2. No hard paywalls on key user features.
3. Self-hosting remains a first-class path.
4. Users can export and move their data without lock-in.
5. Hosted convenience must save time, not remove capability.

## What must remain free and open

1. Provider integration and management in client.
2. Emote rendering and fallback behavior.
3. Emote upload/link/report UX in client.
4. Message/thread/emote reporting entry points.
5. Public API contract shape and protocol docs.
6. Self-host guides for packs/manifests.

## What can be paid convenience

1. Managed hosting and uptime operations.
2. One-click onboarding and team admin UX.
3. Moderation queue tooling and automation dashboards.
4. Support SLAs and enterprise controls.

Rule: paid layers cannot block open protocol compatibility.

## Anti-lock-in requirements

1. Stable import/export formats.
2. Public schema versioning.
3. Clear deprecation windows.
4. No hidden client-side capability gating by plan.

## Governance

1. Policy changes require a public changelog entry.
2. Breaking policy requires explicit maintainer decision record.
3. Regressions toward lock-in should be treated as priority bugs.
