# SevenTV merge-down slice ledger

Each merge-down attempt gets a deterministic receipt in this directory.

## Files

- `SXX.commits`: newline-separated candidate commit SHAs from `seventv-source/chatterino7`
- `SXX.md`: import receipt generated by `scripts/seventv_merge_down.sh`

## Minimal flow

1. Create `SXX.commits` with curated commits.
2. Run `scripts/seventv_merge_down.sh` for the slice.
3. Fill conflict notes and guardrail checklist in `SXX.md`.
4. Open a PR from the integration branch into `main`.
